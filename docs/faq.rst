How can I get a MPD-Box ?
-------------------------

There is no commercial use of MPD-Box for now. It all started as a personnal side-project and will more than likely stay like one.

However, I would recommand you to try finding a Hackerspace or Fablab near your place. Maybe someone there will be interested to help and build one.

Also, feel free to send an email for more support at mpd-box@sebastienbarbier.com.
