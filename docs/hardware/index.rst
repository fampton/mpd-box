Hardware
========

Since day one, PD-Box has been design to run on a **Raspberry Pi** (Model B) using its dedicated `NFC Explorer Board <http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/explorenfc/>`_. However, there is no reason this project does not work on other configuration.


As a target platform, Raspberry Pi will be used as reference to define perfomance limitation.
